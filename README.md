Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):
(SDLC) Is a structured process used for developing sortware systems,ensurind high quality and efficiency,it encompasses a series of phases that guide software projects from inception to deployment and maintenance
Typical phases of SDLC: 1. Planning 2.Requirements Analysis 3.Design 4.Implementation (coding) 5.Testing 6.Development 7.Maintanance

Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.
1. Planning: Objective: Define the scope and purpose of the project
2. Requirement Analysis: Objective: Gather detailed information about what the users need from the system
3.Design: Objection: Convert the requirements into a blueprint for constructing the software
4. Implimanting (coding) Objection: Build the sorfware by trnslating design documents into code
Agile vs. Waterfall Models:
The Agile and Waterfall model are two doctinct approaches to software development, each with its own characteristics,advantages and disadvantages
Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?Waterfall: suitable for projects with well-defined requirements, low likelihood of changes Agile: Ideal for projects with dynamic requirements, where customer feedback is crucial and where the product needs to evolve over time
Requirements Engineering:
Requirement engineering is a critical process in software engineering that involves defining, documenting, and maintaing the requirements for a software system
What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.Requirement enginnering is a critical process in software engineering that involves defining documenting, and maintaing the requirements for a softwae system. The goal is to ensure that the software meets the needs and expectations of its stakeholders, inclunding users, customers and regulatory bodies.Requirement engineering encompasses several activities, including elicitation,analysis specification,validation and management
Software Design Principles:
1. Single Resposibility Principle (SRP) 2.Open/Closed Principle(OCP) 3.Liskov Substitutution Principle(LSP) 4.Inerface Segregation Principle(ISP) 5.Dependancy Iversion Principle(dip) 6.Don't Repeat Yourself(DRY) 7.Keep It Simple, Stupid(KISS) 8.You Aren't Gonna Need It(YAGNI) 9.sEPARATION OF Concerns(SoC) 10. Law of Demeter(LoD) 11.Comoposition Over Inheritance 12.Encapsulation 13.Priciple of LeastAstonishment(POLA)
Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems? Modularity in software design is a fundamental principle that significanlty enhances the maintainability and scalability of software systems. by breaking down a system into smaller, manaeble modules with well-defined interfaces,developers can isolate changes, simplify debugging and enable independent development and incremental growth
Testing in Software Engineering:
1.Unit Testing
2.Intergration Testing
3.System Testing
4.Acceptance Testing
5.Rression Testing
6.Perfomance Testing
7.Security Testing
8.Usability Testing
9Compatibility Testing

Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development? Testing is crucial  in sorftware development because it ensures that the software is of high quality, reliable, secure and meets user needs and business objectives
Version Control Systems:

What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.
Version Control Systems are essential tools in software development, enabling efficient collaboration, maintaining a history of changes,and ensuring code integrity and satbility
1. Git: Distributed VCS: each developer has a complete copy of the repository, including the entire history Features: =Branching and merging: Supports lightweight, fast branching, =Staging area =GitHub/GitLab intergration =Speed and effeciency
2. Subversion(SVN) ;Centralized SVC: A single central repository with all version history. Features: Atomic commits, Directory versioning, Efficient handling of binary files, Accesss control
3,Mercurial: Distributed VCS; Similar to Git, with each developer having a full copy of the repository = Features = Easy-to-use,Perfprmace,Scalability,Extensions
4, Perforce(Helix Core) Centralized VCS:Focuses on perfomanceand scalability for large codebase. Features: High perfomance,Strong support for binary files,Granular access control,Integrations
Software Project Management:

Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects?
The role of foftware project managerismutifaceted, involving planning, team management, stakeholder engagement,risk management and ensuring project success through effective execution and monitoring
Responsibilities of a Software Project Manager:
1.Project Planning: =Defining Scope and Objectives: Established clear project goals, deliverables and requirements, Sceduling:Develop a detailed project timeline,including milestones and deadlines, =Resource Allocation:Identify  
Software Maintenance:

Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle?
Overall, software maintenence is an essential part of the software development lifecycle because it guarantees the continued effectiveness,security and relevence of the software, ultimately contributing to its long-term successand usability
1.Corrective Maintenance: this involves fixings bugs or defects that are discovered afterthe software has been released.
2. Adaptive Maintenance: This focuses on updating the software to keep it compatible with changing environments, such as new operating systems, hadware, or other software applications.
3. Perfective Maintenance: This includes enhancements and improvements to the software based on user feedback or new requirements.
4. Preventive Maintenance: This type of maintenance aims to prevent future prblems by making the software more robust and reducing the likelihood of failures.
Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering:
